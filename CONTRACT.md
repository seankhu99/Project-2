# Contract
By signing this contract you agree to the following terms.
1. We will meet and converge using Discord. Should we need to meet in person all group members are free to schedule a time and day that works for themselves and the rest of the group. The goal is to at least communicate with each other twice a week, with the bare minimium being a text message to one another via Discord. 
2. Work will be divided as evenly as possible. All team members will have to at least work and test HTML, CSS, and Javescript files. We are all in this together and there is enough work to divide fairly. If you favor a certain task please mention it as we all have our strengths and weaknesses.
3. All code must be reviewed by each group member before we can sign off on a pull request. If you need us to sign off sooner, please do not hesitate to use Discord to get us to review your code sooner.
4. Please inform the group about any troubles or emergencies that will prevent you from completing your work. Things happen and we're a group, we just don't want to be left in the dark and assume the worst.
5. Commits must have messages that begin with a verb followed by a description of what changes have occured. 
6. Make rigorous use of the linters Professor Stolley has provided us to ensure code quality.
7. We will strive to follow all requirements of Project 2

# Penalities
In the unfortunate and unlikely event that the terms of this contract are not upheld, the following consequences will occur.
1. If the group has evidence that you have not been communicating with us on top of not meeting your contributions, we will issue a warning by email. 
2. Repeated lack of contribution and communication will result in us contacting Professor Stolley. Should we reach this point, this is the final warning and next consequence will be drastic.
3. After exhausting all options, we will vote to contact Professor Stolley to inform him that we have removed you from our team project. This penality will be extremely unlikely to occur unless such actions have forced our hands.
